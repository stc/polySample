A Polyphonic sample player with adjustable pitch & volume.
(c) GPL3 stc@binaura.net, 2012

The system creates multiple instances of sample players on creation of the [createPoly] object (name of sound file is set by its first argument, whereas number of parallell sounds are based on its second argument). Beware: too much objects can take too much performance especially on mobile devices & tablets.
